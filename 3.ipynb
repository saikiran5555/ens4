    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average (mean) prediction from all the individual trees. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the aggregation process:\n",

    "Training Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the training data. This process involves randomly selecting a subset of the features for each tree and using bootstrapping (sampling with replacement) to create different training sets.\n",
    "Each decision tree is trained independently with its subset of data until it reaches a stopping criterion, such as a maximum depth or minimum number of samples per leaf.\n",
    "Prediction Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "When making predictions on new unseen data, each individual decision tree in the forest produces its own prediction.\n",
    "For regression tasks, the prediction of each tree is a numerical value (e.g., predicted target value).\n",
    "Once predictions are obtained from all the trees in the forest, they are aggregated to produce the final prediction.\n",
    "Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression tasks, the predictions from all the trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor.\n",
    "This averaging process helps to reduce the variance and improve the generalization performance of the model by mitigating the tendency of individual decision trees to overfit the training data."

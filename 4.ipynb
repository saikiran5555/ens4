    "Random Forest Regressor, like many machine learning algorithms, has various hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize the model's performance. Some of the most important hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: This parameter determines the number of decision trees to be used in the random forest. Increasing the number of trees generally improves the model's performance, but it also increases computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_features: It specifies the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split at each node. It can be an integer (representing the exact number of features) or a float (representing a fraction of the total number of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "max_depth: This parameter controls the maximum depth of each decision tree in the forest. Limiting the depth helps prevent overfitting by restricting the complexity of individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_split: It defines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Increasing this parameter can lead to simpler trees and help prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: This parameter sets the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. Similar to min_samples_split, it helps control the complexity of the trees and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "bootstrap: A boolean parameter indicating whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If set to True, each tree is built using a bootstrap sample of the training data, which introduces randomness and helps in reducing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "random_state: It is an integer or a RandomState instance that controls the random number generation for bootstrapping and feature selection. Setting a random state ensures reproducibility of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "n_jobs: This parameter specifies the number of parallel jobs to run for both fitting and predicting. Setting it to -1 uses all available CPU cores."

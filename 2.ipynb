    "Random Forest Regressor is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that utilizes the principles of decision trees to perform regression tasks. It reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation): Random Forest builds multiple decision trees based on random subsets of the training data, which is known as bagging. Each tree sees only a fraction of the total data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: In addition to using random subsets of the data, Random Forest also selects a random subset of features for each tree to split on. By considering only a subset of features at each node, it reduces the likelihood that the model will learn noise or irrelevant patterns present in the data, thus mitigating overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Averaging: Instead of relying on the prediction of a single decision tree, Random Forest aggregates the predictions of multiple trees. This averaging helps to smooth out the predictions and reduce the variance, making the model less susceptible to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Max Depth and Minimum Samples per Leaf: Random Forest allows tuning parameters such as maximum depth and minimum samples per leaf. By restricting the depth of individual trees or imposing constraints on the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node, it prevents the trees from growing too complex and capturing noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error: Random Forest uses out-of-bag samples (samples not included in the bootstrap sample for a particular tree) to estimate the model's performance during training. This estimate helps in tuning the model and identifying if it's overfitting."

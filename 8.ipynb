    "Yes, Random Forest Regressor can be used for classification tasks, but it's more commonly used for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a classification task, the Random Forest algorithm is typically implemented as a Random Forest Classifier rather than a Regressor. The Random Forest Classifier works similarly to the Regressor variant but is designed to predict discrete class labels instead of continuous numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Random Forest Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each decision tree in the ensemble predicts the class label of an input sample.\n",
    "The class label predicted by each tree is considered as a \"vote\".\n",
    "The final predicted class label is determined by majority voting among all the trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "Random Forest Classifiers have several advantages for classification tasks, such as handling non-linear decision boundaries, handling high-dimensional feature spaces, and providing estimates of feature importance. They are also robust to overfitting, thanks to the ensemble averaging mechanism."

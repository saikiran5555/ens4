    "A Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It's an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the average prediction of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Selection of Data: It randomly selects a subset of the training data (with replacement) to train each decision tree. This process is known as bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Selection of Features: At each node of the decision tree, it considers only a random subset of features for splitting. This helps to decorrelate the trees and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Construction: Each decision tree is constructed independently. They're typically grown deep (i.e., they're allowed to have many levels) and aren't pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voting/Averaging: For regression tasks, the output of the random forest regressor is the average prediction of all the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressors are known for their robustness and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality. They often perform well without much hyperparameter tuning and are less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees."

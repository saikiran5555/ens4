    "The output of a Random Forest Regressor is a predicted numerical value for each input data point. Since Random Forest Regressor is used for regression tasks, its output consists of continuous values rather than discrete categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you provide a new set of features (input data) to a trained Random Forest Regressor model, it uses the ensemble of decision trees to generate predictions. Each individual decision tree in the forest produces its own prediction, and the final output of the Random Forest Regressor is typically the average (mean) of these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the output of a Random Forest Regressor is a single numerical value representing the predicted target variable for the given input data point. This prediction represents the model's estimate of the target variable's value based on the learned patterns in the training data."
